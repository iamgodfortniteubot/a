<p id="p1"> The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game. </p>
